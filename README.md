## 🎯 Introduction
Financial applications require rigorous testing to ensure compliance, security, and accuracy. Manually creating test cases is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project automates test case generation and execution using an AI-driven approach with a T5-based model, Flask, JIRA integration, and Selenium.

## 💡 Inspiration
Testing financial applications manually is inefficient and often incomplete. This project was inspired by the need for a scalable and intelligent testing system that ensures financial transactions are processed correctly while reducing manual effort.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- **AI-Powered Test Case Generation**: Uses a T5-based model to generate test cases from feature descriptions.
- **JIRA Integration**: Fetches feature descriptions directly from JIRA.
- **Excel-Based Test Case Management**: Stores and tracks test cases with execution status.
- **Automated Test Execution**: Uses Selenium to execute test cases on a sample financial application.
- **Real-Time Test Monitoring**: Updates test results in the Excel sheet automatically.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- **Trained a T5 Model** on sample financial test cases to generate context-aware test cases.
- **Developed a Flask Web App** to interact with the AI model and fetch feature descriptions.
- **Integrated JIRA API** for seamless test case generation from issue descriptions.
- **Used Pandas with Excel** to store and track test cases.
- **Automated Execution with Selenium**, logging into the sample financial application to verify transactions.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
- **Fine-tuning the T5 Model** to generate relevant and meaningful test cases.
- **JIRA API Integration** and handling different formats of feature descriptions.
- **Ensuring UI & API Compatibility** for Selenium test execution.

## 🏃 How to Run
